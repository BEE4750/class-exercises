# Linear Programming Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to derive, implement, and analyze a linear programming model using `JuMP.jl`.

The instructions for the exercise are given in `instructions.html` (which is based on `instructions.jmd`, though you shouldn't need to open that source directly, as you don't need to write a report). Use `scratch.jl` for your coding.

As a reminder, `JuMP` does not like re-defining variables. Re-run your entire script as you modify your model.
