# Simulation Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to simulate the wastewaster system example from class. An environment file is provided for the packages that you should need.

The instructions for the exercise are given in `instructions.html` (which is based on `instructions.jmd`, though you shouldn't need to open that source directly, as you don't need to write a report). Use `crud_simulation.jl` for your coding.
