# Simulation-Optimization Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to gain a better understanding of how to use simulation-optimization to optimize a "black box" systems simulation model.

The instructions for the exercise are given in `instructions.html` (which is based on `instructions.jmd`, though you shouldn't need to open that source directly, as you don't need to write a report). Use `scratch.jl` for your coding.
